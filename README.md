This is an helper package for using UMAP + DBSCAN in R.

This package can't / must not be used right now :

- highly experimental : everything is subject to breaking changes
- no documentation
- low quality code : almost no tests, doesn't pass CRAN checks
- bugs, bugs, bugs

You've been warned !



## TODO

- noise_inherit_parent should return <Noise> if no no-noise parent
- add test on reproducibility of results
